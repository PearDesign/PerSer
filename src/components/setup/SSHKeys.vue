      Just like on a mobile device or laptop, a server will refuse to do
      anything unless you've logged in. Unlike those devices, which use a
      password or fingerprint to authenticate, a server uses something called an
      "SSH Key". These are long files that you keep on the device you're using
      right now. Whenever you use PerSer to tell your server to do something
      (such as creating a new user or installing a program) your SSH key is sent
      as well.

      Unless you're doing something complicated with your server, setting up SSH
      Keys is simple: go to "SSH Keys" and then click "Create a new SSH Key"

# Welcome Series
The app should have a "New To Stonehenge?" link that's easily available that starts a paginated welcome series. The series should be brief on each slide, with friendly, illustrative animations.

Title: Stonehenge
Server management made easy

## Page 2:
Stonehenge is a tool for managing servers of your own.

Servers are computers, just like your laptop or cell phone. There are only a few differences:
- 1) Instead of your living room, the server is in a data center somewhere.
- 2) Instead of buying a computer, you rent it by the month.

## Page 3:
Companies that rent out servers keep them secured in big data centers, where
they make sure that the internet is always connected, the power is always on, and no one but you can access it.

## Page 4:
"But I already have two computers! Why do I need a third?"

The main reason is that a server is always connected. That means that you
can run all sorts of different apps for yourself. 

(In the next section, illustrations describe what an app looks like with
and without a server)

- Messaging 
- Social media
- Shopping

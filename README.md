# PerSer
A non-technical server management utility

## About
PerSer is an app that enables users to manage servers without technical experience.

## How It Works
PerSer is agent-less, meaning it doesn't have any requirements for what it installs onto the server. If you have a devops background, you can think of it like Ansible with a GUI in front of it for accomplishing common tasks.
